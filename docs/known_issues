#1 Text has been seen vanishing on 2 Linux machines (Ubuntu and Arch
respectively) when using the gl viewport. This does not happen when using
the OpenGL graphics system, and does not happen on mac

This has been introduced since Qt 4.7.1, investigating, use that tag if you
need this working with GL now
