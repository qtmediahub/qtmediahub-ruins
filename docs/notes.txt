General

Hardware permitting, I would strongly recommend that you run qmake with:

qmake -config glviewport

in order to use the Qt OpenGL graphics system

QML

It appears you have to use: forceActiveFocus to change focus if no item currently has active focus

Qt.createComponent does not appear to be cognizant of import calls in said file

Can't query/discover path of QML file being run (making it impossible to use generic qmlviewer for skin work)
