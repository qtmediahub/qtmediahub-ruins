This source tree contains the Qt Components project.

Building
========
configure (for compiling specific component sets add '-config mx' and/or '-config meego')
make
make install

The project is divided into:

- The library libQtComponents: contain general purpose helpers for C++;
- The module Qt.labs.components: _for now_ contains general purpose helpers for QML.

and also (for the time being) two QML modules for component sets implemented using those components

- com.meego: components from MeeGo Touch UI library;
- Qt.labs.Mx: set of UI components inspired by the Mx toolkit.

The lib will install in QTDIR/lib, while the modules will go to QTDIR/imports.

Build dependencies
==================
- Qt 4.7

Optional dependencies
=====================
- MeeGo Touch (for the com.meego module)
  -- On desktop, download and install: libmeegotouch & meegotouch-theme from http://meego.gitorious.org/meegotouch
  -- NOTE: meegotouch is already available if you are compiling inside scratchbox with a maemo6 target setup

Coding Style
==================
Follow the respective Qt coding style for C++ and QML files and the
JavaScript coding style for JS only files.

Coding Styles
- Qt C++: http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtCodingStyle
- QML: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qml-coding-conventions.html
- JS: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Coding_Style

Running on Desktop
==================
- Pass -graphicssystem native




Build instructions for MeeGoTouch (quickstart)
==============================================
(After trying to install things in a different prefix,
 I gave up since I couldn't get meegotouch to find its theme.)

You will need these projects:
git://gitorious.org/meegotouch/meegotouch-theme.git
git://gitorious.org/meegotouch/libmeegotouch.git
git@gitorious.org:qt-components/qt-components.git

1: meegotouch-theme: qmake PREFIX=/usr/local/ && sudo make install

2: libmeegotouch:
   ./configure
 Make sure that you configure with dbus. If it doesn't pick up qt's dbus:
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QTDIR/lib/pkgconfig
   make install

# mmoc is required
3: export PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH

4: qt-components: ./configure -config meego && make install
     (installs into your current binary qt path)
     or use dpkg-buildpackage to make a .deb package

On destop: -graphicssystem native needed:
5: run example: cd qt-components/examples/meego/calculator && ./calculator -graphicssystem native

6: switching theme: gconftool-2 --type string --set /meegotouch/theme/name "THEMENAME"
